<h1 class="ic4f-main-heading">About me</h1>

<p>I am Sergey Golitsynskiy. This is my personal website. Right now most of it is about my coding
projects, but I hope sooner rather than later it will become broader than that, with programming as
its unifying theme.
 
<p>I enjoy programming. I wrote some Basic in high school, and I got my Commodore 64 soon after school,
but I only started writing actual programs in my late 20s, so I'm a late bloomer. I learned most of
my CS foundations in Java, occasionally dipping into Scheme (thank you, 
<a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/">Eugene</a>; thank you, 
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">SICP</a>) and a
few other languages. Despite the 
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/">Perils of JavaSchools</a>, 
I'm very happy with the CS foundation I got at UNI, besides, I did learn C later on.. I also wrote
quite a few .NET web applications in C#, and occasionally did some PHP as well. Nowadays I write
mostly Python, JavaScript and, most recently, TypeScript. I don't have a favorite language; one
thing I know I would hate is to end up using just one.
 
<p>Over the past several years I've been an <a href="http://sergey.cs.uni.edu">assistant professor</a> 
in an interdisciplinary program at the University of Northern Iowa, teaching mostly introductory
computer science and web development, while exploring and writing programs for 
<a routerLink="/projects/fortepan_iowa">digital archives</a>. Prior to that, a substantial part of
my work had been on content management system architecture and, to some extent, generative
programming, mostly in the context of web applications. I used that experience for my master's
thesis: I built an <a routerLink="/projects/codegenerator">object-relational mapper/code generator</a>, 
that took a specification for an app and generated all the data access+storage code for that
application. 
 
<p>I also wrote a considerable amount of research code in <a routerLink="/projects/avocado">a variety of areas</a>, 
mostly dealing with <a routerLink="/projects/phd">large scale text processing</a> - but only to
discover, over and over again, that to me <em>building the tools</em> for research was by far more exciting
than using them to address specific research questions. As Fred Brooks famously said, "scientists
build to learn, engineers learn to build." Building things is what makes me happy and curious for
more knowledge.
 
<p>I <em>do</em> code for fun, and it's hard to come up with a definitive explanation why. CS for me was a
conscious decision I've never regretted. I enjoy programming like I enjoyed exploring Tolkien's
Middle-earth, or cataloguing and rearranging <a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/lotw">my home library</a>, 
or maybe even building toy cities as a child. To me, the fun comes from designing a structure,
incrementally adding detail and simplifying the arrangement of the parts - and in the end having a
complex, yet elegant "machine", that also "magically" comes to life and performs seemingly
impossible tasks. Whether it's a report-generating app, or a system guiding the next Mars rover -
it's <em>the complexity of what lies beneath</em> that makes it so interesting.

<p>I live in beautiful Gaithersburg, MD, with my wife <a href="http://alinaavanesyan.com/">Alina</a>, 
who is a postdoc at the University of Maryland (she is the real scientist); and 
<a href="http://alinaavanesyan.com/blog/2018/05/maryland-day-in-pictures/">Alice</a>, our little
daughter, who loves her books and stuffed animals, and learned the sl (steam locomotive) bash
command at age 2 :-)
